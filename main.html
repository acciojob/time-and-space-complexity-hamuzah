 <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. It measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute. An algorithm with efficient time complexity completes its task in a reasonable amount of time, even as the size of the input increases.</p>

<p>Space Complexity is a measure of the amount of memory space required
	by an algorithm to execute in relation to the size of the input.
	It quantifies the amount of memory used by the algorithm to solve the problem.
	In the context of big O notation, it is often represented as O(n), where n represents the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> is crucial to consider, especially when dealing with large datasets or memory-constrained environments.</p>
